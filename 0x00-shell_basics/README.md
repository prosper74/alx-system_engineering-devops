This project is to understand shell basics and writing bash files

###Some bash file notes:
- All bash file must have `#!/bin/bash` at the top of the file
- To compile a bash file and make it executable, run `chmod +x <file name>`
- To run a bash file, use `./<file name`
- Magic files (i.e .mgc files) don't need to have the `#!/bin/bash` comment at the top of the file
- To compile a .mgc file and make it executable, run `file -C -m <your magic file>`
- To run a .mgc file run `file -m <your magic file>`
