# Bash Processes and Signals
This project covers fundamental concepts related to Bash processes and signals in Unix-like operating systems.

### PID
PID stands for Process Identifier. It is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each running process in a Unix-like operating system.

### Process
A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. It contains the program code and its current activity, including its own address space, memory, and other system resources.

### Finding a process' PID
There are several ways to find a process' PID:
- Using the ps command: ps aux | grep <process_name>
- Using the pgrep command: pgrep <process_name>
- Checking the PID file associated with the process, if applicable.

### Killing a process
To terminate a process, you can use the `kill` command followed by the PID of the process you want to terminate. For example: `kill <PID>`. You can also use the `killall` command to terminate all processes with a specific name.

### Signal
A signal is a software interrupt delivered to a process to notify it of an event or to request that it perform a particular action. Signals can be generated by the operating system, by other processes, or by the process itself.

### Two signals that cannot be ignored
- `SIGKILL` (signal number 9): This signal terminates a process immediately and cannot be caught or ignored by the process.
- `SIGSTOP` (signal number 19): This signal suspends the process until it is resumed by a `SIGCONT` signal. Similar to `SIGKILL`, it cannot be caught or ignored by the process.
