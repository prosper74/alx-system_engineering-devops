# Web stack debugging
Web stack debugging refers to the process of identifying and resolving issues or errors that occur within the various layers of a web application's technology stack. The web stack typically consists of multiple components, including the frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), backend server (such as Node.js, Django, Flask), database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB), and other supporting services (e.g., caching, load balancers).

### Protocol:
A protocol refers to a set of rules or guidelines that determine how data is transmitted and received over a network. It defines the format, timing, sequencing, and error control of messages exchanged between devices. Protocols are essential for enabling communication between different devices and systems, ensuring interoperability and reliability.

### IP Address:
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main purposes: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the device in the network. There are two primary versions of IP addresses: IPv4, which uses a 32-bit address format, and IPv6, which uses a 128-bit address format to accommodate the growing number of connected devices on the internet.

### TCP/IP:
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of networking protocols that provides the foundation for communication on the internet and most local area networks (LANs). TCP/IP defines how data is transmitted over the internet by breaking it down into packets, routing them to their destination, and then reassembling them at the receiving end. It consists of several protocols, including TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable, connection-oriented communication, and IP (Internet Protocol) for addressing and routing packets.

### Internet Protocol (IP) Port:
An IP port is a communication endpoint identified by a numerical value within the IP address header of a packet. Ports allow multiple services or processes to run on a single device and enable them to communicate with other devices over a network. Each port on a device is associated with a specific protocol and service. For example, port 80 is commonly used for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) web traffic, while port 22 is used for SSH (Secure Shell) connections. Ports are categorized into three ranges: well-known ports (0-1023), registered ports (1024-49151), and dynamic or private ports (49152-65535).
