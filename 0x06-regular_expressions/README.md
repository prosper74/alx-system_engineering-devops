# Regular Expressions (Regex) Readme

Regular expressions, commonly abbreviated as regex or regexp, are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They provide a powerful and flexible way to search, extract, and manipulate text data.

## Key Points:

- **Pattern Matching:** Regex allows you to specify patterns of characters to match within strings.

- **Metacharacters:** Certain characters such as `^, $, ., *, +, ?, (), [], {}, |` have special meanings in regex and are known as metacharacters.

- **Character Classes:** Character classes like `[a-z]` allow you to specify sets of characters to match.

- **Quantifiers:** Quantifiers such as `*, +, ?, {}` specify the number of occurrences of a character or group to match.

- **Anchors and Boundaries:** Anchors like `^` and `$` specify the start and end of a line or string, while `\b` and `\B` match word boundaries.

- **Groups and Capture Groups:** Parentheses `()` are used to create groups, allowing for more complex patterns and extraction of matched text.

- **Alternation:** The `|` character allows for alternation between different patterns.

- **Escape Characters:** Backslashes `\` are used to escape special characters, allowing them to be matched literally.

- **Modifiers:** Modifiers like `i, g, m` can change the behavior of the regex, such as case insensitivity or global matching.

- **Lookaheads and Lookbehinds:** Lookaheads `(?=...)` and lookbehinds `(?<=...)` assert conditions without consuming characters.
