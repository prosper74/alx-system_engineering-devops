Postmortem: E-commerce Platform Outage Due to Database Schema Mismatch
Issue Summary
Duration: March 15, 2023, 09:00 - 10:30 AM EST (1.5 hours)
Impact: 100% of users experienced 500 Internal Server Errors, resulting in complete revenue loss during the outage.
Root Cause: Database connection failure due to a Mongoose schema defining 'productvariants' collection instead of the actual MongoDB collection 'product_variants'.
Timeline

09:00 AM EST: Issue detected via customer support ticket.
09:05 AM EST: Engineering alerted by monitoring spike in 500 errors.
09:10 AM EST: Investigation focused on recent deployments and server logs.
09:25 AM EST: Shifted focus to database after Mongoose connection errors in logs.
09:40 AM EST: Escalated to senior backend engineer and DBA.
10:00 AM EST: Root cause identified: collection name mismatch.
10:15 AM EST: Fix implemented by correcting schema and restarting server.
10:30 AM EST: Service fully restored and operational.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause
A new Mongoose schema for product variants incorrectly specified the collection name:
javascriptCopy codeconst ProductVariantSchema = new Schema({
  // schema fields...
}, {
  collection: 'productvariants'  // Incorrect
});
The actual MongoDB collection was named 'product_variants'. This mismatch caused Mongoose connection failures, crashing the application.
Resolution
Updated the schema to use the correct collection name:
javascriptCopy codeconst ProductVariantSchema = new Schema({
  // schema fields...
}, {
  collection: 'product_variants'  // Corrected
});
After updating and restarting the server to reload configurations, Mongoose successfully connected to the 'product_variants' collection.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Database Schema Management

 Audit all Mongoose schemas for collection name accuracy.
 Implement quarterly schema review process.

Naming Convention

 Document and enforce snake_case for MongoDB collections.
 Create linter rule/pre-commit hook for schema/collection name validation.

Testing

 Add tests for Mongoose CRUD operations on each collection.
 Integrate collection tests into CI/CD pre-deployment.

Monitoring and Alerting

 Add monitoring for Mongoose connection events.
 Set up alerts for Mongoose-related errors.

Deployment

 Implement canary deployments to catch issues pre-rollout.
 Add post-deployment smoke tests for collection read/write.

Knowledge Sharing

 Tech talk on Mongoose best practices and pitfalls.
 Update onboarding docs with naming importance.

Backup and Recovery

 Review and test rollback procedures.
 Train all devs on rapid deployment rollback.

Conclusion
This incident highlights how minor naming inconsistencies in full-stack development can cause major outages. Our corrective measures focus on enforcing naming conventions, enhancing testing and monitoring, and improving our deployment and recovery processes. These steps will fortify our system against similar issues and reduce downtime in future incidents.
